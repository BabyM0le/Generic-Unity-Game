# Generic-Unity-Game
In preparation for visiting Hutch Games' office, I made the decision to create a Unity game (MVP) - something I have never done before. During the week I gave myself to learn and build a game I realised that It would take more time to learn Unity and C#, so I gave myself an extra 2 weeks of learning. The full game download can be found here: https://tompadmanathan.com/pages/first-game. The main focus of this small project was to see what I could do in a short period of time, the emphasis was on speed, not quality hence why there are no custom models and a lack of styling. I hope in the future I can complete more complex projects with the Unity Engine. Whilst Unity has been self-taught, I welcome all feedback so I can incorporate that into Version 1.0.
